									<h1>StellarGrowth Case<br />
									5 Year P&L Budget</h1>
								</header>

								<!-- Text stuff -->
									<h2></h2>
									<p><b>In this Financial Planning and Analysis project, I constructed different financial planning schedules for the next 5 years, based on the latest StellarGrowth financial statements and a set of assumptions. Advanced Excel techniques that were used include PivotTable, SUMIF, xLookup, and Sparklines. </b> 
								
									
									<header>
										<h2>Case Descriptions</h2>
									</header>
									<p>StellarGrowth Co. is a dynamic and innovative consumer goods company that provides high-quality products for individuals and families. With a strong focus on meeting the diverse needs of its customers, StellarGrowth has established itself as a trusted brand in the market. It has five major revenue streams:
									    <li>Personal Care</li>
										<li>Home Care</li>
										<li>Pharmaceuticals</li>
										<li>Leisure and entertainment</li>
										<li>Baby & Kids</li></p>

									<header>
	
									</header>
									<p>While following a stringent financial plan, StellarGrowth keeps its revenue streams only if they generate positive revenue growth. A stream will be discontinued if revenue growth declines for two consecutive years.</p>
									<header>
										<h2>Business Task</h2>
							
									</header>
									<p>Given the latest financial statements, a list of employees (by department and function) and a set of assumptions, build StellarGrowth's budget and gain insights into the company's operations.</p>

									<h2>Step 1: Construct the Payroll Budget</h2>
									<dl>
										<dt></dt>
										<p>According to the assumptions, Leisure and Entertainment Stream will be discontinued as it had negative revenue growth over the two years, and 20 new employees were added to the list of Employees & Salaries (five employees in each of the other four Streams).</p>
										<p>Old employees's salaries were calculated based on the salary changes below:
										<li>Production Department: Directors and managers will have a 10% salary increase each consecutive year; Blue collar workers will have a 5% salary increase each consecutive year.</li>
										<li>Marketing Department: Marketing & Sales employees will not have any change in salaries; Sales representatives will have a 10% increase in Y4, 7% increase in Y5, no change subsequently.</li>
										<li>Finance Department: 7% increase salary increase for all employees in the next five years.</li></p>
				                        <p>The salaries of new employees are planned to be the average of their peers each year. The number of current employees in each Stream and total salaries they will make in the next 5 years were calculated to get the average salary for new joiners. </p>
										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/Budgets/Average of New Hire.png" alt="" /></span>
										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/Budgets/New Employees.png" alt="" /></span>
										<p>Once the estimates of all employees' salaries were ready, budgets for payroll expenses (including Admin Expenses and Selling Expenses) and GOGS-payroll were calculated. </p>
										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/Budgets/Payroll Expenses & COGS-Payroll.png" alt="" /></span>

									</dd>
									<h2>Step 2: Construct the Revenue & COGS Budgets</h2>
									    <p>The assumptions for Revenue & COGS are listed as follows:
											<li>15% growth in the Baby & Kids Stream</li>
											<li>Same historical revenue growth in the Personal and Home Care Streams</li>
											<li>COGS-Other will have a 6% annual growth each consecutive year</li>
									        <li>The company will operate at a fixed Gross Profit Margin (GPM) in the next 5 years</li></p>
										
										<p>The COGS budget is split into COGS-Payroll and COGS-Other. The COGS-Payroll amount was calculated from Step 1, and COGS-Other was calculated based on the 6% annual growth.</p>	
										<p>Knowing that the GPM is fixed at 25%, Revenue budget for the next 5 years can be calculated: Revenue = COGS/(1-25%) </p>
										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/Budgets/Revenue and COGS budget.png" alt="" /></span>
										<p>Revenue amount for three Streams (Personal Care, Home Care and Baby & Kids) can be calculated based on the growth assumptions, and the Pharmaceutical revenue is a reconciling item (subtract the total revenue of three other Streams from the total revenue).</p>
										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/Budgets/Revenue breakdown by Streams.png" alt="" /></span>

									<h2>Step 3: Construct the Training & Development and Interest Budget</h2>	
									    <p>As per the assumption, the annual lump sum approved for the Training and Development will be canceled, and the allowance of $200 per employee will increase to $400. Therefore, the T&D budget can be constructed by inputting a zero lump sum budget and an allowance of $400 per employee, starting as of Y4. The total number of employees are already calculated from Step 1.</p>	
									    <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Budgets/T&D Budget.png" alt="" /></span>
										<p>Interest expense will continue to decline by $2,000 annually in the next 5 years.</p>
										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/Budgets/Interest Expense.png" alt="" /></span>
										<p><a href="https://1drv.ms/x/s!AhjUKyV6RF2HoyEEZowZWVPPlf0i?e=hWrkiu">See the link for my Excel worksheet</a></p>
									<h2>Step 4: Construct the P&L Budget</h2>
									    <p>Summarizing work based on the calculations above, the 5-Y P&L Budget sheet was constructed.</p>
										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/Budgets/5 Y P&L- Revenue.png" alt="" /></span>
										<p>Gross Profit = Total Revenue - Total COGS</p>
										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/Budgets/5Y PL COGS.png" alt="" /></span>
										<P>Operating Profit = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses (Payroll expenses and T&D expenses)</P>
										<p>Net Income = Operating Profit - Interest Expenses - Tax Expenses</p>
										<p>The applicable tax rate is 10%.</p>
										<span class="image fit"><img src="images/Budgets/5Y P&L NI.png" alt="" /></span>
										<p><a href="https://1drv.ms/x/s!AhjUKyV6RF2HoyPjmFzLdf8tocj_?e=yDWtBO">See the link for my Excel worksheet</a></p>
									<h2>Summary</h2>
									<p>Given the above calculated budget schedules, StellarGrowth may consider discontinuing the Pharmaceuticals Stream, as the revenue amount is predicted to drop more and more in four of the five years.</p>
									<p>Although the revenue amount seems to decline in Y4, primarily because of the removal of the Leisure and Entertainment Stream. In the long run, the removal is a right decision as the total revenue will go up again and increase even more.</p>	
									<p>Similarly, hiring new employees and increasing the T&D expenses bring the Net Income down only in short term. Starting from Y5, the net will go up, and the growth keeps steady over the rest four years.</p>
