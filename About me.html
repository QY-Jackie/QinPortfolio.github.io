									<p>Qin Yao, CPA<br />
									I'm actively seeking a role as a financial analyst, accounting analyst or business analyst, <br />
									where I can leverage my skills and experience to provide data-driven insights and contribute to organziational success.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/About me.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I am a strongly analytical CPA-licensed auditor with over 5 years of experience of internal audits, database management, and federal fund program monitoring. Graduating from University at Albany, State University of New York, I hold a master's degree in accounting.</p>
								<p>As a Senior Auditor, I have successfully lead internal audits and reviews, developed audit plans and strategies, and performed data analysis using advanced Excel skills (such as Power Query, Pivot Table, and Xlookup, etc.). I am also experienced at maintaining organized documentation, preparing reports, and faciliating communication between different departments.</p>
								<p>One of my accomplishments for my current position is developing a Power BI dashboard to upgrade the audit data tracking functions. To expand my skill set, I recently completed two certificate programs: Google Data Analytics and Business and Financial Modeling Specialization. The Data Analytics certification has equiped me with practical skills in collecting, transforming, and analyzing data. From the Business and Financial Modeling Specialization program offered by University of Pennsylvania, I learned how to harness the power of spreadsheets to map and predict data, and how to evaluate investment projects using different criteria.</p>
                                <p>Proficiency in Microsoft Excel and Power BI serves as a strong foundation for my data analysis and visualization abilities. I leverage these tools to extract valuable insights, identify trends, and present complex data in a clean and concise manner. Currently, I am further developing my expertise in SQL and Python to deepen my data manipulation and analysis capabilities.</p>
								<p>Outside work, I like running, reading and traveling. I recently visited Tokyo and love the city so much that would definitely visit again. Thank you for visiting my portfolio website, and I welcome any opportunity to connect with potential employers to explore how my experience and skills can contribute to organizational success.</p>
